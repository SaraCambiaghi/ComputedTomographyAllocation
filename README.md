# CT Exam Scheduler

This repository accompanies the article *"Computed Tomography Allocation in an Emergency Department: Comparison of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods as Support Tools."*

It provides a toy example demonstrating how predictions made with machine learning techniques can assist in balancing radiology workload across weekdays.

## Features

- Dynamic form generation based on the number of patients and the selected balancing criterion  
- Selectable scan types, departments, and patient/exam details  
- Basic optimization to balance radiology workload  
- Visualization of classic vs. optimized scheduling, using both expected and simulated outcomes via Monte Carlo methods
